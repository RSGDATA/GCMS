# How to Use the GitHub Pages Deployment Documentation

This guide explains how to use the documentation resources I've created to help you understand the GitHub Pages deployment configuration for your Symphony Portal project.

## Documentation Resources

I've created three main documentation resources:

1. **Comprehensive Guide** (`github_pages_deployment_guide.md`)
2. **Component Relationships CSV** (`deployment_components_relationships.csv`)
3. **Deployment Flow Diagrams** (`deployment_flow_diagram.md`)

## How to Access and Use These Resources

### 1. Comprehensive Guide (Google Docs)

The `github_pages_deployment_guide.md` file contains detailed explanations of all components and configurations.

**To use with Google Docs:**

1. Go to [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com)
2. Create a new document
3. Click on File > Import
4. Upload the `github_pages_deployment_guide.md` file
5. Select "Import as Google Docs document"

This will create a formatted Google Doc that you can read, edit, and share.

### 2. Component Relationships (Google Sheets)

The `deployment_components_relationships.csv` file shows how different components relate to each other.

**To use with Google Sheets:**

1. Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com)
2. Create a new spreadsheet
3. Click on File > Import
4. Upload the `deployment_components_relationships.csv` file
5. Select "Import data" with these settings:
   - Import location: "Replace current sheet"
   - Separator type: "Detect automatically"
   - Convert text to numbers, dates, and formulas: Yes

**Creating Relational Sheets:**

Once imported, you can create multiple sheets to better visualize the relationships:

1. Rename the first sheet to "Components"
2. Create a new sheet called "Relationships"
3. Copy the data under "Component Relationships" from the first sheet to the "Relationships" sheet
4. In the Components sheet, select all data and create a table (Data > Create a filter)
5. Do the same for the Relationships sheet
6. You can now filter and sort the data to better understand the relationships

### 3. Deployment Flow Diagrams (Mermaid)

The `deployment_flow_diagram.md` file contains Mermaid diagrams that visualize the deployment process.

**To view and edit these diagrams:**

1. **Online Mermaid Editor:**
   - Go to [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/)
   - Copy the Mermaid code from the markdown file (the text between the triple backticks)
   - Paste it into the editor
   - The diagram will render automatically
   - You can make changes and see them in real-time
   - Export as SVG or PNG for your documentation

2. **GitHub:**
   - If you push this file to your GitHub repository, GitHub will automatically render the Mermaid diagrams when viewing the file

3. **VS Code:**
   - Install the "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension
   - Open the markdown file
   - Right-click and select "Open Preview"
   - The diagrams will be rendered in the preview

## Recommended Study Approach

To get the most out of these documentation resources, I recommend the following approach:

1. **Start with the Flow Diagrams:**
   - Open the `deployment_flow_diagram.md` file in a Mermaid viewer
   - Study the overall process flow to get a high-level understanding

2. **Explore the Component Relationships:**
   - Import the CSV into Google Sheets
   - Review how different components interact with each other

3. **Deep Dive with the Comprehensive Guide:**
   - Import the guide into Google Docs
   - Read through the detailed explanations of each component
   - Use this as a reference when you need specific details

4. **Hands-on Practice:**
   - After understanding the documentation, try making a small change to your project
   - Commit and push to GitHub to see the deployment workflow in action
   - Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow to see each step in the process
