## Next Steps

To complete the GitHub Pages deployment setup:

1. Commit and push all these changes to your GitHub repository
2. Configure GitHub Pages in your repository settings:
   - Go to Settings > Pages
   - Set the source to "GitHub Actions"
3. Add your environment variables as GitHub Secrets:
   - Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
   - Add secrets for all environment variables in your .env.local file

Once these steps are completed, your site will be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages whenever you push changes to the main branch.
